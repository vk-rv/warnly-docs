## Overview

Warnly is an open-source exception monitoring platform designed for development teams that demand simplicity, speed, and transparency. Built as a compelling alternative to proprietary solutions, Warnly eliminates the complexity and cost overhead of traditional error tracking systems.

### Intelligent Error Aggregation

Warnly employs grouping algorithms that automatically cluster related exceptions, reducing alert fatigue and noise. Rather than drowning teams in hundreds of similar error reports, the platform consolidates patterns while preserving critical context.

### Zero-Complexity Deployment

Installation is straightforward: integrate the SDK, configure an endpoint, and you're operational. The self-hosted nature means your data stays your data, and deployment costs scale linearly with actual usage rather than pricing tiers.

### Performance First

Warnly processes and indexes exceptions in milliseconds. Real-time alerts arrive instantly, dashboards render without lag, and historical searches execute at scale without degradation.

### No Arbitrary Limitations

Warnly removes the economic incentive to limit functionality. Teams can monitor as many applications, capture as many exceptions, and invite as many developers as needed. Scaling is governed by infrastructure capacity, not commercial terms.
