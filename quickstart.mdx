This guide will walk you through installing Warnly, creating your first project, sending your first error event, and viewing issues in the user interface.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended for quick start)
- Go 1.25+ (for building from source)
- MySQL 8.0+ or compatible database
- ClickHouse 24+ for analytics

## Installation

### Using Docker Compose (recommended)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vk-rv/warnly.git
   cd warnly
   ```
2. Copy the environment variables file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```
3. Start the services:

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

   Or directly with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   This will start:
   - MySQL on port 3326
   - ClickHouse on ports 8133 (HTTP) and 9030 (native)
   - Warnly on port 8080

## Configuration

Warnly uses environment variables for configuration. Key settings:

```bash
# Databases
MYSQL_DSN=warnly:root@tcp(localhost:3306)/warnly?interpolateParams=true&parseTime=true&timeout=2s&loc=UTC
CLICKHOUSE_DSN=clickhouse://root:root@localhost:9000/warnly?dial_timeout=900ms&connection_open_strategy=in_order&compress=true&max_open_conns=55&max_idle_conns=50&conn_max_lifetime=5m&max_execution_time=10

# Server
SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
SERVER_PORT=8080
SCHEME=http

# Auto SQL migrations
FORCE_MIGRATE=true

# Admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin

# Sessions
SESSION_KEY=your_32_byte_secret_key
```

## Accessing the Interface

After starting, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

Log in with the admin credentials:

- Email: [admin@example.com](mailto:admin@example.com)
- Password: admin

## Creating Your First Project

1. In the Warnly interface, click "New Project"
2. Fill in the project details:
   - Name: My First Project

3. Click "Create"

## Sending Your First Event

Warnly accepts error events via HTTP API. You can send events using Sentry envelope format for compatibility with Sentry clients.

## Viewing Issues

1. In the interface, navigate to the "Issues" section
2. You'll see grouped errors from the sent events
3. Click on an issue to view details, including stack traces and metadata
